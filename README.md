      <td valign="text-top">Lightning boy remains as my first simple game, inspired by Super Mario Bros where you gotta jump and avoid obstacle in order to reach to your winning places.

      <td valign="text-top">WEE Land is a game that entirely forgoes combat system. Your main objective is to survive as long as possible maintaining the Welfare, Entertainment and Education meter for the citizen. You are given a limited budget to satisfy the need of the citizen.
